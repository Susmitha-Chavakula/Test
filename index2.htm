<h1>Understainding HTML</h1>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. Site authors use HTML to format text as titles and headings, to arrange graphics on a webpage, to link to different pages within a website, and to link to different websites. It describes the structure of a Web page. It consists of a series of elements. It's elements tell the browser how to display the content. The purpose of a web browser(Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document. Since the early days of the World Wide Web, there have been many versions of HTML(present HTML 5 standard). <p>
